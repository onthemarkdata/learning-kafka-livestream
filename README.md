# Documenting My Kakfka Learning Journey!  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97306794/210161248-1e2f5520-49ca-418c-87b3-e20160ea8ffd.png)

I'm currently learning Kakfka to grow my data engineering skills and dive deeper into my obsession with streaming data. In this repo you will find:  
- The resources I am referencing to learn.
- Summaries of my learnings.
- Code with documentation.
- Recording of my livestream.

*Please note that this shouldn't be considered a tutorial on Kafka, but rather documenting how I approach learning new technologies. There may be mistakes or misinterpretations, but if it's brought to my attention I will work to rectify it in this repo.*
